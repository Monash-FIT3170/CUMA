## Development Guide

### Setting up

#### 1. Install Node.js and npm

https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

#### 2. Setup Local Repository and install dependencies.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Monash-FIT3170/CUMA.git`

Open command prompt or terminal in the root directory (CUMA), and run the following command: `npm install`.

#### 3. Allow Database Access

Download the .env file and remove the `_`, then place into the root directory (CUMA).

### How to run the server

In the root directory (CUMA), run the following command: `npm run server`


### How to run the web

#### 1. Install Live Server

Install "Live Server" extension on VS Code

#### 2. Run the web

Navigate to `index.html`.
This file is located in `/cuma/front-end/index.html`

Open this html using Live Server.

The server runs the API and connects to mongoDB. Therefore, this command must be run first
before npm install can be queried.



## Project structure


### Root Directory

The root directory is defined to be in the same hierarchy as app.js and package.json.


### cuma Directory

`cuma` directory is separated as:

- `front-end`: contains the View and Controller. For example, `index.html` (view) will have a matching `index.js` file (for the controller logic).
- `back-end`: Contains the interaction with the API tier
- `api`: Contains the API logics, route handlers and the connection to the database.

This web is designed to be a three-tier application, where `front-end` makes a call to `backend`. `backend` will then make a fetch request to the API. The API is handled by `api` where it will query the database.
